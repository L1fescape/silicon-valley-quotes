Attorney: Do you have any skill at all, other than magically failing your way to the top? \nBig Head: I have a boat.
Lawyer to Gavin Belson: You can’t threaten him. Especially not sexually.
Erlich: You're a mean and terrible attorney.\nPete Monahan: I'm not an attorney.
Gilfoyle: Are you saying this entire thing hinges on whether Richard ever had a girlfriend?
Gilfoyle: Are you saying 'Work Will Set You Free'?
Dinesh: He's the most cheerful person I've ever heard quote Hitler.
Erlich: Everyone who has ever sued me has settled out of court. Pussies.
Erlich: Anal dilation aside, what do you think of our case? We're gonna go in there and dick-slap those Hooli pieces of shit?
Drink shots with Russ Hanneman.
Jared: If I use you as references, can I count on you to say nice things about me? Be honest. Gilfoyle: Do you want me to be honest or nice?
Russ Hanneman: I’m sorry, do you really talk like that?
Gavin Belson: Fuck! \nAudious: Invalid command. \nGavin Belson: Fuck!\
Gavin Belson: That was horrible. I just got humiliated by a fucking teenager at Techcrunch Disrupt and you give me this... tampon ad?
Gavin Belson: I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness if first we achieve goodness. 
Dinesh: I should not have eaten all that Satanist chicken. 
Erlich: Cool with a K.
Richard: So take your shitty tequila and your shitty jeans with fucking metal chunks on them, and get the fuck out of here.
Let's drink to re-billionizing.
Gilfoyle: He's not gonna do shit.\nHe's a coder. By definition, we're all pussies.
Gilfoyle: Pretend like you've seen a woman before.
Erlich: You look like a ferret who gave up on himself six months ago, Gilfoyle.
Gilfoyle: Why don't we livestream me killing you?
Doctor: We had a meth addict in here this morning who was biologically younger than you are, and he’s 58. Myspace guy. 
Jared: We're The Beatles. Now we just need Yoko.\nDinesh: Yeah, that's the worst example you could have used.
Dinesh: Is that Flo Rida? - \nGilfoyle: No idea.
Brooke: Cool costume. Where'd you get it? \nRichard: Uhh - Uh, my bed.
Erlich: He's Chinese. He's talking about this crack-addict prostitute we saw at the gas station. She was smoking cigarettes.
Gilfoyle: I bet you're right.\nHe probably is just ripping his hair out somewhere.\nI wish I could see that.
Russ Hanneman:  No, Richard, giving you money right now is the worst thing I could do for you.
Richard: You bought yourself a gift to prove you're not an asshole?\nRuss Hanneman: Right.\n\n
Russ Hanneman: You know what's  hard about being a billionaire, Richard? You never know if anyone likes you, or your money.\n
Laurie: The pedophile-facing nature of the app could present marketing pain points, yes...\n\n
Erlich: Pedophiles are typically not early adopters. So we'd probably miss out on that whole market.\n\n
Richard: I'm just watching and waiting. I love kids. BUT NOT LIKE THAT!\n\n
Erlich: This is Palo Alto. We don't enjoy all the freedoms you do in China.\n\n
Richard: Do you think we got him fired?\nGilfoyle: We did. Awesome.\n\n
Russ Hanneman: We are going to drink to re-billionizing!\n\n
Gilfoyle: You're paranoid that we're not paranoid enough?\nDinesh: You're para-paranoid, Richard.\n\n
Russ Hanneman: *pointing at Jarrod* This guys fucks, am I right?\n\n
Erlich: Richard, I know that you look at me and see a guy who has it all figured out.\n\n
Ehrlich: You tore Double Asshole a third asshole! Triple-A!\n
Gilfoyle: Will they ever find those earrings?\n\n
Erlich: You've basically done the deed. Which for you is basically ejaculating in your pants and all over your leg and apologising profusely
Gilfoyle: It's time to walk the left hand path, Richard.\n\n
Richard: Gilfoyle, please don't tell me you hacked into End|Frame's system.\nGilfoyle: OK, I won't tell you that.\n
Russ Hanneman: These are not the doors of a billionaire, Richard. Fuck you.\n\n
Gilfoyle: It is a mystery why you think you'll ever see a woman naked.\n\n
Russ Hanneman: But now that I'm spelling billionaire with an M...\n\n
Russ Hanneman: Functionally I'm just like you. Jesus fuck that's depressing.\n
Richard: But you're still a billionaire.\nRuss Hanneman: Not if you round down. If you round down I have zero billions.\n
Molly Kendall: Pioneering, cutting edge interfaces across new device platforms like Oculus and iWack...\n\n
Russ Hanneman: I'm a nine-hundred-and-eighty-six-ionaire. Which isn't even a thing.\n
Erlich: Put the pen down, Dumbledork.\n
Gilfoyle: Says here she's looking for a 'man on the go'. But you don't go anyway.\n
Richard: If you don't fund us, you're a fucking slut.\n
Erlich: Your logo looks like a sideways vagina. I find that to be racist. Don't you?\n
Gavin Belson: It's not iPhone 4 bad, is it?\n
Gavin Belson: Is it Windows Vista bad?\n
Gilfoyle: He's gonna lose speed and hit that wall and - die.\n
Gilfoyle: She's definitely going to fuck him later and she's not going to be thinking of you whilst it's happening. 
Erlich: This is the type of evening that requires free-balling.\n
Richard: For thousands of years, guys like us have got the shit kicked out of us. But we can be the Vikings of our day. 
Erlich: Jared? I want you call the VC's and set up meetings with all of them. Line 'em up. Nuts to butts. 
Erlich: Hey Dinesh! Get in the fucking car! There may be a drive-by about to happen! \n
Dinesh: Inferior products win out all the time. \nGilfoyle: Like Jesus, over Satan. \nDinesh: I was going to say VHS over Beta.\n
Dinesh: You're Canadian? \nGilfoyle: Your borders are merely a construct. I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world. 
Jared: I hope you don't mind sitting next to a cyborg.\nCarla: Does he fart a lot and smell like onions? Well, he is a coder. 
Erlich: Don’t touch anything! Failure is contagious. 
Peter Gregory: Did you just take a sip from an empty cup?\n
Erlich Bachman: We'll call you when we need pleated khakis.\n
Erlich Bachman: Your muffins smell like shit, so do your ideas. 
Erlich Bachman: You know, Russ, I've been known to fuck myself.\n
Dinesh: I was already happy you got punched in the face, but now I’m super happy!\n
Ehrlich: There's been some developments. You know how I fucked Melcher's old wife? I fucked his new wife too. 
Belson: Fuck you, the audio’s still working! Audio worked a hundred fucking years ago, you fucking piece of shit! 
Jared: Don't think of it as a cubicle. Think of it as a neutral-colored enclosure about yay-high around your work space.
Jared: You promised this guy $10,000 without any approval? Are you high?\nErlich: A little bit yeah, but that's irrelevant. 
Erlich: We're walking in there with three-foot cocks covered in Elvis dust. 
Gavin: I don't want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do. 
Gilfoyle: As far as Pied Piper is concerned, he's as pointless as Mass Effect 3's multiple endings. 
Dinesh: It looks like a guy sucking a dick, with another dick tucked behind his ear for later. Like a snack dick.\n
Gavin Belson: If we can make your audio and video files smaller, we can make cancer smaller. And hunger. And... AIDS.
Richard: "Jobs was a poser. He didn't even write code."
